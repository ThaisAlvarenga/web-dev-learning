# web-dev-learning
The purpose of this repo is to be a tracker of my learning and practice of web development skills. This repo contains projects and notes that I have made in my web development learning journey.

Though I originally thought of just doing front-end development, I decided to have a full-stack approach to my learning and later on see what I am more interested in. 

Things I am currently learning are:

- HTML
- CSS

For the future:
- Bootstrap 
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Node.js
- React.js
